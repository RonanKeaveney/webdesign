        <h1>Season 1</h1>
        <p>The series introduces us to the brutal and mysterious world of Ragnar Lothbrok, a Viking warrior and farmer who yearns to explore  and raid the distant shores across the ocean. His ambition puts him at odds with local chieftain Earl Haraldson, who insists on sending his raiders to the impoverished east rather than the uncharted west. When Ragnar teams up with his boat builder friend Floki to craft a new generation of intrepid ships capable of conquering the rough northern seas, the stage is set for conflict.</p>

        <p>But for all its warfare and bloodshed, Vikings is also a story of family and brotherhood, capturing the love and affection between Ragnar and his wife, Lagertha, a fierce Shield-maiden. It is the tale of Ragnar's brother Rollo, a fierce fighter who simmers with jealously; of Earl Haraldson's wife Siggy, a dutiful beauty who may be less than loyal; and of the monk Athelstan, whose Christian morals clash with the Vikings pagan society. As ambition and innovation rattle a civilization, these characters will be put to the test and their way of life will never be the same again.</p>
        <h1>Season 2</h1>
        <p>The hit scripted drama series centers on Ragnar Lothbrok, a restless young warrior and family man who longs to find and conquer new lands across the sea and claim the spoils as his own. Now he is an Earl, allied with King Horik. With more power than ever before, his desire to sail west and explore new kingdoms remains unquenchable.</p>
        <p>Yet there's a heavy price to pay for Ragnar's ascent to greatness. Season two brings crises of faith, of power, and of relationships. Brothers rise up against one another. Loyalties shift from friend to foe, and unlikely alliances are formed in the name of supremacy. Ragnar's indiscretions threatens his marriage to Lagertha, tearing him and his beloved son apart. Plots are hatched, scores are settled, blood is spilled... all under the watchful eyes of the gods.</p>
        <h1>Season 3</h1>
        <p>The new 10-episode season begins with Ragnar as King and follows the great responsibility that now rests on the shoulders of the former farmer.</p>
        <p>With the promise of new land from the English, Ragnar leads his people to an uncertain fate on the shores of Wessex. King Ecbert has made many promises and it remains to be seen if he will keep them. But ever the restless wanderer, Ragnar is searching for something more... and he finds it in the mythical city of Paris. Rumored to be impenetrable to outside forces, Ragnar and his band of Norsemen must come together to break down its walls and cement the Vikings legend in history.</p>
        <p>The gripping family saga of Ragnar, Rollo, Lagertha and Bjorn continues as alliances and loyal friendships are questioned, faith is catechized and relationships are strained. Vikings tells the extraordinary tales of the lives and epic adventures of these warriors and portrays life in the Dark Ages, a world ruled by raiders and explorers, through the eyes of Viking society.</p>
        <h1>Season 4</h1>
        <h2>Part I</h2>
        <p>Season three culminated with the extraordinary battle in Paris, where Ragnar seized victory from the jaws of defeat but still returns to Kattegat dangerously ill. Thoughts of his death galvanize the forces who seek to succeed him as king, including his wife Queen Aslaug and his oldest son, Bjorn. Meanwhile, Lagertha continues power struggles with her calculating, former second in command, Kalf. Rollo betrays his Vikings heritage by remaining in Frankia and Floki is seized for his brutal actions to the Christian priest Athelstan.</p>
        <h2>Part II</h2>
        <p>In the midseason premiere, Ragnars reappearance in Kattegat triggers a chain of events no one except the Seer could have ever imagined. He unexpectedly arrives home to see what has become of his sons.</p>
        <h1>Season 5</h1>
        <h2>Part I</h2>
        <p>In Norway, in the wake of the death of King Ragnar and his son Sigurd, the sons of Ragnar are in civil war. Ivar claims the title of king over the kingdom of Kattegat, supported by Hvitserk and king Harald. Ubbe sides with Lagertha against their alliance. In England, King Aethelwulf and bishop Heahmund wage war against the Nordic invaders. In the Mediterranean, Bjorn follows his destiny as he and Halfdan explores northern Africa. On the Atlantic, Floki makes a discovery that will change the world of the Norsemen forever.</p>
        <h2>Part II</h2>
        <p>In Norway, Lagertha's army is on the brink of being routed from Kattegat, with Ivar prepared to captured the city and claim his revenge. In England, after the passing of King Aethelwulf, Aethelred rallied the Lords behind his half-brother Alfred and proclaimed him King of Wessex. In Iceland, the feud between the families of Kjetill and Eyvind escalate to the point where each of their sons are killed. Determined to prevent further bloodshed, Floki offers himself as a sacrifice.</p>
